    <h3>Need/Problem</h3>

    <p>ToolWatch's flagship applications is a very dated winforms app.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used a very complex and unstable merge replication system to allow users to work offline.</li>
        <li>Larger organizations suffered from poor performance</li>
        <li>All users have been plagued with unreliable behavior</li>
        <li>The app is tightly coupled. It all begins with the forms and grids, the business and data layers
            are built upon grid objects, not POCO's
        </li>
        <li>The nature of the replication system makes any changes very difficult and extremely risky. There
            have been 2 outages lasting 2 weeks or more in the last year.
        </li>
        <li>Deployment uses click-once, and different clients are on different versions.</li>
        <li>Based on a single SQL Server database</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The new app should be web based</li>
        <li>It should be connected</li>
        <li>Use a newly developed Restful API</li>
        <li>UX is to be considered a priority</li>
        <li>Must work on modern browsers</li>
        <li>Must be backward compatible with the legacy application</li>
        <li>Should use Google, Amazon, E bay and other commercial sites as inspiration</li>
        <li>Initial Minimum features include: Search, Tools, Employees, Locations, Move, and Authentication</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Solution</h3>

    <p>
        It was decided we would develop A new application based on HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, and Bootstrap.
        The new framework would use the newly
        developed enterprise API (REST). This will reduce the load on the single SQL server database (due to
        constantly cued merges)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap will allow us to provide a fresher more interactive user
            experience.
        </li>
        <li>Angular allows the UI logic to be shifted client side, while the API will ultimately be
            responsible for ensuring all business logic/rules are implemented
        </li>
    </ul>

            </a>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="media-body">
        <h4 class="media-heading">Module: Core</h4>

        <p>
            The core module is designed to be exactly that, it is the core, all other modules depend on it. It
            includes features such as Authentication,
            Navigation, and
            in-app Notifications. It is required to be included in each sub-app.
        </p>

        <p>
            Authentication is done against the Security API using email, password, and accesskey (assigned to
            each application). Upon successful
            authentication an authorization token is returned to the client. This token is to be sent along in
            all subsequent requests, identifying
            the user. If at any point client receives a status code 401, the app then requires the user to login
            again.
        </p>

        <p>
            Navigation is rather simple, the core however keeps track of which module the user is in making it
            as active in the navigation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The final feature to discuss is Notifications. Shinobi was designed to be connected from the
            beginning, one feature that was paramount was notifications. At design time, there were really two
            types of notifications. The first is what we call in-app notifications. These notifications are a
            way for the app to communicate important information to the user as it happens. Examples include an
            action being canceled, records being added to a move, or a move being submitted to ToolWatch and so
            on. Currently all in-app notifications are centered around the Move module (discussed later on).
        </p>

        <p>
            The second type of notification, comes from the server, an example of this is the server notifying
            the client that their move has been processed.
            This second type of notification becomes quite critical as the team moves further along the road
            map, moving into distributed systems. Once work
            becomes asynchronous, usually through queuing then there will be a bit of a disconnect between users
            requesting and action and the completion of
            that action (the is often referred to as “eventual consistency”). Implementing such systems are
            critical to taking the next step in scalability.
            Ultimately, server notifications will help users know when there request has been filled. Lateron,
            the roadmap calls for socket.io to further improve
            the user experience and feeling of being connected to ToolWatch systems.

    <div class="media-body">
        <h4 class="media-heading">Module: Tool</h4>

        <p>
            The app at its core is an asset tracking/management system, and the most important assets to the system are
            tools. So it is no shock
            that the tool module gets the most attention.
        </p>


        <p>Feature: Tool Search</p>

        <p>
            The tool search is probably the most exciting part of the system. It starts with an Google style
            auto-suggest. This is backed up by
            a lightning fast Search Api (part of the Enterprise API). Each keystroke calls the API and the results are
            sorted by relivance, returning upto 100 results.
            Each result represents a model or category each representing many individual tools. Honestly, I would love
            to say more, but is so unbelievably simple!
        </p>

        <p>
            After selection the model or category, you want it leads to a results page. The Amazon style results page
            detailing what was selected
            and how many results were found. below that there are two panes, on the left are related filters including
            manufacturer, assignment, and status.
            Selecting any of these options immediatly filters the result set. On the right is a list of results
            including pagination, sorting, and actions that
            can be taken on each item.
        </p>


        <p>Feature: Tool Detail</p>

        <p>
            One of the actions that can be taken from the search results is getting the detail of a specific tool. Here
            you can see critical info such as the model,
            description, manufacturer, notes, and the individual assignments for the tool
        </p>

        <p>Feature: Employee Detail</p>

        <p>
            This is a rather simple module, as with tools it starts with the search. After selecting a specific employee
            you are taken to the employee detail where (like tool detail) you are presented relivant details on the
            employee including name,
            contact info, and tools assigned to that person.

    <div class="media-body">
        <h4 class="media-heading">Module: Location</h4>
        <p>Feature: Location Detail</p>

        <p>
            As with employee this is a simple module, and again you can find locations using the search. After selecting
            a specific location
            you are taken to the location detail where (like tool detail) you are presented relivant details on the
            location including name,
            address info, and tools assigned to that location.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlink employees, locations also allow for a way to see the complete list, in a Google style result set.
            Filtering is included,
            limiting the list as you type.
