Title: Need a neat title

Tags: Portfolio, Blog, Digital Presence

Problem:
Peak1 wanted a new website, one that showed off their work.  In addition here area a few other requirements:
- Need to be able to filter
- Need to have large and small copies
- Should be modern looking
- Should show why Peak 1 is good?
- Would like to have a blog
- Keep costs down
- Avoid using backend services if possible

Solution:
Develop a site using HTML5, JS, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JQuery Quicksand plugin.

Benefits include:
Responsive, Sexy interface and filtering system (Jquery QuickSand), full size and thumbnail images.
The system has no backend server component, and was on budget.

Blog is on the roadmap.
