    <h3>Need/Problem</h3>
   <p>ToolWatch's flagship applications is a very dated winforms app.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used a very complex and unstable merge replication system to allow users to work offline. </li>
        <li>Larger organizations suffered from poor performance</li>
        <li>All users have been plagued with unreliable behavior</li>
        <li>The app is tightly coupled.  It all begins with the forms and grids, the business and data layers are built upon grid objects, not POCO's</li>
        <li>The nature of the replication system makes any changes very difficult and extremely risky.  There have been 2 outages lasting 2 weeks or more in the last year.</li>
        <li>Deployment uses click-once, and different clients are on different versions.</li>
        <li>Based on a single SQL Server database</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The new app should be web based</li>
        <li>It should be connected</li>
        <li>Use a newly developed Restful API</li>
        <li>UX is to be considered a priority</li>
        <li>Must work on modern browsers</li>
        <li>Must be backward compatible with the legacy application</li>
        <li>Should use Google, Amazon, E bay and other commercial sites as inspiration</li>
        <li>Initial Minimum features include: Search, Tools, Employees, Locations, Move, and Authentication</li>
    </ul>
</div>
        <div>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
                It was decided we would develop A new application based on HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, and Bootstrap.  The new framework would use the newly
                developed enterprise API (REST).  This will reduce the load on the single SQL server database (due to constantly cued merges)
            </p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap will allow us to provide a fresher more interactive user experience.</li>
    <li>Angular allows the UI logic to be shifted client side, while the API will ultimately be responsible for ensuring all business logic/rules are implemented</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Module: Core</h4>
    <p>
        The core module is designed to be exactly that, it is the core, all other modules depend on it.  It includes features such as Authentication,
        Navigation, and
        in-app Notifications.  It is required to be included in each sub-app.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Authentication is done against the Security API using email, password, and accesskey (assigned to each application).  Upon successful
        authentication an authorization token is returned to the client.  This token is to be sent along in all subsequent requests, identifying
        the user.  If at any point client receives a status code 401, the app then requires the user to login again.
    </p>

    <p>
        Navigation is rather simple, the core however keeps track of which module the user is in making it as active in the navigation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The final feature to discuss is Notifications.  Shinobi was designed to be connected from the beginning, one feature that was paramount was notifications.  At design time, there were really two types of notifications.  The first is what we call in-app notifications.  These notifications are a way for the app to communicate important information to the user as it happens.  Examples include an action being canceled, records being added to a move, or a move being submitted to ToolWatch and so on.  Currently all in-app notifications are centered around the Move module (discussed later on).
    </p>

    <p>
        The second type of notification, comes from the server, an example of this is the server notifying the client that their move has been processed.
        This second type of notification becomes quite critical as the team moves further along the road map, moving into distributed systems.  Once work
        becomes asynchronous, usually through queuing then there will be a bit of a disconnect between users requesting and action and the completion of
        that action (the is often referred to as “eventual consistency”).  Implementing such systems are critical to taking the next step in scalability.
        Ultimately, server notifications will help users know when there request has been filled.  Lateron, the roadmap calls for socket.io to further improve
        the user experience and feeling of being connected to ToolWatch systems.
