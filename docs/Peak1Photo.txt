Peak 1 Photography

Photo Story:  Title


Problem:
Peak1 wanted a new website, one that showed off their work.  In addition here area a few other requirements:
- Need to be able to filter
- Need to have large and small copies
- Should be modern
- Should show why Peak 1 is good?
- Would like to have a blog
- Keep costs down
- Avoid using backend services if possible



Solution:
Develop a site using HTML5, JS, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Jquery Quicksand plugin.

Benefits include:
Responsive, Sexy interface and filtering system (Jquery QuickSand), full size and thumbnail images.
The system has no backend server component, and was on budget.

Blog is on the roadmap.
