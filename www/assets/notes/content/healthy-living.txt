Nutrition – Healthy Choices for Growing Kids
Menus include a variety of foods which meet daily nutritional needs for young children and satisfy licensing requirements. When substitutions are necessary, we’ll maintain the nutritional content of the overall menu. Substitutions will be posted to keep you apprised of what’s been served.

Meals are served family style and may include your child assisting in areas such as:

Table setting
Food serving
Cleaning up
